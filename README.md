#  Shockwave Generator using Cavities

> A CFD-based analysis using ANSYS Fluent to investigate the effect of cavity geometry on shockwave amplification within a 2D shock tube.

##  Overview

This project explores how different cavity geometries affect pressure amplification in a supersonic shockwave environment. The shock tube is modeled in 2D using ANSYS Fluent 2023 R2, and several shapesâ€”semicircular, elliptical, rectangular, triangular, and double semicircularâ€”were tested under identical boundary conditions to quantify their impact on shockwave behavior.
